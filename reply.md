Subject: Re: Request for Re-evaluation – Blind XSS with Administrative Impact

Hello,

Thank you for your response and for confirming that the finding is valid and has a real security impact.

I completely understand your position regarding the asset valuation and the inability to award a monetary bounty for XSS on low-value assets. I respect the program’s rules and appreciate your transparency.

Since the report is being accepted as valid, I would like to kindly request that you consider awarding the **maximum possible points** for this finding. Given the confirmed **High Severity** impact (authenticated administrative execution, PII access, and potential for privilege abuse), a higher points award would be greatly appreciated and would help reflect the true severity of the discovery in my researcher ranking.

This recognition would be a strong motivation for me to continue digging deeper into your assets and contributing to the program’s security.

Thank you again for your time and for managing this report.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
